# Web Content Extract Dify Plugin

This is a Dify plugin that extracts clean content from web pages using the [web-content-extract](https://github.com/amoyens1s/web-content-extract) Node.js library. The plugin calls the library directly through command-line interface, eliminating the need for MCP server configuration.

## Features

- Extracts main content from web pages using Mozilla Readability
- Converts content to Markdown or JSON format
- Extracts comprehensive SEO metadata
- Works without MCP server configuration
- Uses your excellent web-content-extract Node.js library directly

## Prerequisites

This plugin requires Node.js to be available in the Dify runtime environment:

- Node.js 16+ must be installed on the system where the plugin runs
- The plugin will automatically use `npx` to call the `web-content-extract` library
- No MCP server configuration is required

## How It Works

Instead of requiring an external MCP server, this plugin:

1. Directly calls the `web-content-extract` library via command-line interface using `npx`
2. Passes the URL and options as command-line arguments
3. Captures and processes the JSON output
4. Returns the extracted content to Dify

This approach eliminates the need for MCP server configuration while still leveraging your excellent web-content-extract implementation.
